## Work Summary (Missing Features)
 * Transactions aren't able to be undone 
 * Don't know if this was a required feature but loaded in default accounts do not have preloaded Transactions. Transactions do fully work but user needs to perform some operations for them to be generated. Also expanded Transactions so it displays all Transactions for an account's history rather than only 10. 
 * Don't know if this was a required feature since I didn't see the directions requireing it, but the operations and changes made to an account are not saved to a file for this demo.
